          DecryptoX Privacy Policy
DecryptoX (“we,” “our,” or “us”) operates this Privacy Policy to explain how we handle information of users who use our platform and participate in our Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The DecryptoX team places a high priority on privacy protection standards to deliver bank-grade security for users accessing a blockchain environment.

Information We Collect
A. Non-Personal Information
During the ICO phase, DecryptoX collects certain types of non-personal information to facilitate seamless transactions, optimize platform functionality, and uphold security standards. This information includes:
• Wallet Address: Collected when users connect a cryptocurrency wallet to interact with the platform, enabling us to process token purchases, verify eligibility for participation, and securely complete transactions.
• Transaction Data: Records of token purchases, transfers, staking actions, and all other blockchain-based transactions. This data supports transaction tracking, regulatory compliance (where necessary), and platform analytics.
• Usage Data: The system observes user website activity by recording page selections along with click sequence records and protocol addresses and browser styles and time periods spent using the platform. The data serves several purposes including enhanced platform security and both security improvement and user experience enhancement.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-300">
            Refunds for ICO participants are not available due to the
            decentralized nature of blockchain transactions, which are
            inherently irreversible. We recommend that all participants
            carefully review their investment decisions, as funds contributed to
            token purchases or staking programs cannot be retracted once the
            transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. In the event of disputes
            or inquiries, participants can reach out to our support team, who
            will evaluate cases individually and, where possible, offer guidance
            or information.
